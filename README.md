# Timer - DROPPED

Simplistic time tracking app.
Effortlessly log your activities & monitor your time spending.

<details>
<summary>Motivation</summary>

Again and again i have heard or read that keeping track of how you spend time has got many benefits [1].

On every occasion i've failed to build the habit.

The main issue i've found is the time logging takes.

So I thought, wouldn't it be easy to build an app where i can log events on just the click of a button?

And while at it, why not try a few of those technologies that were buried in the backlog of things to learn [2].

> [1] You can read on the benefits of time tracking on this [article](https://alifeofproductivity.com/how-to-track-your-time/) or this [experiment](https://zapier.com/blog/time-tracking-tutorial/)

> [2] Things I've used for this project: Next.Js, mobile-first, WPA, typescript
> Plus practiced some soft skills like writing (documentation), reading (articles, documentation, code) and getting feedback from others.

## Dropped

This project has been dropped. I've opted for using [Simple Time Tracker](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.razeeman.util.simpletimetracker&hl=en&gl=US&pli=1) which covers most of my ideas without the need of implementing it.

A particular case of the build vs buy dilemma, where the existing solution is free.
